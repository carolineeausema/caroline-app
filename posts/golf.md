###### These are my thoughts as I navigate my golf class. I may provide more updates throughout the semester.

#### This is all just Downton Abbey
During my Senior fall semester at Purdue, I’ve taken up a golf course. My intention was to pick it up for later in life, so that I could golf with my dad & attend events with my future coworkers. When I told friends and family about my plans, most of them giggled: apparently I am really not the type of person who you would typically imagine pulling up to a golf course (unless I'm working as a cart girl). But this got me thinking. . . what gives me this anti-golf quality?

On my last first day of school, I pulled up to the Purdue golf course and immediately caught a  vibe of men shooting birds in Downton Abbey. Golf is seen as a prestigious, leisure sport. I imagine luxury attire, sports cars at the country club, and manicured lawns. It’s interesting to compare this to the wealthy in the early 1900’s. While golf has a rich history, it’s worth acknowledging that it has earned its reputation as an elitist sport. We may like to imagine the present as a post-aristocracy, post-servantry world, but to me, golf is a medium that really reaffirms the existence of those structures.

#### Anti-Golf Syndrome
Before this course, I didn’t pay much mind to “anti-golf syndrome” (i.e. my made-up term for a condition where a person doesn’t look like they play golf). What I didn’t realize is how many people are being left out of golf, then left out of opportunities because of it. Taking this golf class (I’m not even halfway through it as I’m writing this) has made me question who it’s all for: Who is the most comfortable in these spaces? Who naturally has the most access to this sport? Who is benefitting from the relaxed-business atmosphere that surrounds golf?

Knowing how to play golf comes with some serious benefits. Its emphasis on etiquette and attitude makes it a way to judge someone’s character. But what if you were never taught the rules? What if you don’t know how to fix your ball mark? Or what if you don’t own golf clothes? There are some factors that play in that make this sport an unfair judge of character:
- **Cost Barrier:** Golf clubs, green fees, exclusive athleisure, membership fees. . .these are all “must-haves” in golf. Golf requires an investment in expensive equipment, which often fully restricts access to the sport.
- **Racial Demographics:** The most common ethnicity among golfers is White, which makes up 72.8% of all golfers. Comparatively, 8.9% of golfers are Black or African American and 7.5% of golfers are Hispanic or Latino. [Source](https://www.zippia.com/golfer-jobs/demographics/)
- **Gender Ratio:** 28.4% of golfers are women and 71.6% of golfers are men. [Source](https://www.zippia.com/golfer-jobs/demographics/)

  *If you actually click the "what women wear golfing" link, it may remind you a bit of a creepy middle school dresscode.*
- **Alternative Appearances:** Tattoos, piercings, dyed hair, and clothing that doesn’t fit into the dri-fit, athleisure attire expectation.

- **Upbringing:** Perhaps above all else, if you don't have family who forces you to golf as a kid, it's a lot harder to get into this sport. The vocabulary, technique, and social norms all initially come from your family. It doesn't get more elitist than that.

I'll finish up with a quote from my required textbook for my golf class, [Golf Naked](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/6225194): "But if you're not comfortable at the golf course and if you're not committed to the process, you won't come back."
