# Generative AI in Consulting: A Content Remixer, Not an Autonomous Creator

## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, Generative AI has sparked both curiosity and concern across nearly every industry – and technical consulting has been no exception. Embracing this transformative technology has led us all to question the essence of creativity, intelligence, and human ingenuity: What does it mean to be a problem solver? What goes into making a good decision? As we delve into the possibilities and challenges of Generative AI in consulting, it becomes crucial to understand its true nature as a content remixer, not an autonomous creator.

## Shift in Perspective

All AI in the world today falls under the category of narrow AI: systems that perform a small number of narrowly defined tasks. In her book, “Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans,” Melanie Mitchell discusses how this differs from what we know as “general AI”: an AI that equals or surpasses humans in most ways. Contrary to common misconceptions, Generative AI does not conjure up content out of thin air; rather, it excels at remixing the existing content it has been meticulously trained on – this is its narrowly defined skill. Mitchell writes, “A pile of narrow intelligences will never add up to a general intelligence. General intelligence isn’t about the number of abilities, but the integration between those abilities.” Recognizing this distinction is essential to gaining a clearer sense of what the field has accomplished and how much farther it has to go.

## The Role of Training

The essence of any Generative AI’s output is rooted in the data it absorbs during its training phase. Similar to a skilled DJ blending different tracks to craft a unique mix, AI remixes and reinterprets the extensive dataset it has absorbed. This demonstrates the pivotal role of high-quality data in shaping an AI’s unique output - who wants to listen to a DJ’s remix of a song that’s objectively terrible? Or lacks production quality? One that’s offensive? The data that AI draws from must be from a diverse range of unbiased sources, allowing it to synthesize content that is innovative, familiar, and fair. If the training set is so important, it could be argued (and it often is) that the Engineers that train a given model are the creators of all content produced by that model. Whether or not this is the case, or if it’s one of the world’s many grey areas, is in the eye of the beholder.

## Unlocking Potential

The applications of Generative AI are multifaceted and hold immense potential. Imagine a dynamic website that adapts its content in real-time based on user preferences and behavior, offering a personalized experience to each visitor. Envision an e-learning platform that generates tailored lessons based on individual learning styles, experience, and progress in order to build engagement and comprehension. The implications have a far reach, impacting industries like healthcare, finance, creative arts, and beyond. Generative AI’s unique ability to remix existing content holds promise of driving innovation and efficiency in ways previously unimaginable.

While Generative AI has massive potential to increase productivity, efficiency, and innovation, it’s not creating anything new. There’s a disconnect between the hype surrounding AI and the field’s actual achievements, where we may forget the importance of human ingenuity. We still need humans to be at the forefront of creativity, to bring about the next Clair de Lune or Mona Lisa, cooking up the next Philly-Cheesesteak. ChatGPT can produce a solid travel itinerary for your next vacation, but it has no understanding of the beliefs that humans have or how we behave. Midjourney can produce technically proficient artwork, but it has no basic knowledge of how living things differ from inanimate objects. This discrepancy is what makes Generative AI a powerful tool – not a replacement for human cognition.

## Conclusion

Generative AI thrives as a transformative content remixer, not a standalone creator. Utilizing this technology doesn’t mean relinquishing control; rather, it’s a powerful tool that promotes efficiency. We invite you to explore how the unique nature of Generative AI could be used to reshape content creation and reimagine the way you connect with your online audience - one remix at a time.
