# Hi.

[This](https://github.com/carolineeausema/carolines-app) is the repository for my personal website. You can visit the live site [here](https://carolineausema.vercel.app/).

## About

This whole project started as the idea of a portfolio. Since then, I've added some extras & tinkered around enough to get p5 implemented. It has become a fun little side hobby (that I am slightly addicted to working on).

## Technologies Used

- Next.js
- Vercel (hosting)
- CSS
- p5.js
- Spotify API
- BlazeFace
- TensorFlow.js

## Features

- Home
    - Scroll + Fade top elements with p5
    - Grid Selection
    - Currently Playing Song on Spotify
- Coursework
- Art Sketches
    - p5 doodles
